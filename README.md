## 🎯 The Problem

- **Alternative data** is a $2.7B market → $17B by 2030
- Wall Street uses satellites, weather data, social sentiment
- **Crypto has nothing biological** — until now

## 💡 The Solution

A living tomato plant connected to IoT sensors, generating verifiable biological data on-chain that correlates with crypto prices.

**Proof of Concept:**
- 🌱 59+ days of continuous data
- 📊 Humidity ↔ Price correlation validated
- 🤖 Claude AI manages plant growth
- 📈 Trading bot live for 48h+

## 🏆 Why This Matters

| Traditional Finance | Crypto (before SolTomato) | Crypto (after) |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Satellite imagery ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Weather data ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Social sentiment ✅ | ✅ Santiment | ✅ |
| **Biological data** ✅ | ❌ | **✅ SolTomato** |

---

## 📊 Data Moat

- **59+ days** of unique, timestamped biological readings
- **Impossible to replicate** — time cannot be bought
- **On-chain verifiable** (coming soon)
- Every day that passes = deeper moat

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
